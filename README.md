This project builds a Research Paper Answer Bot using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer questions grounded in Generative AI and LLM research papers.
The system indexes research PDFs into a vector database, experiments with multiple embedding models and retrieval strategies, and generates responses with source attribution.
Designed to simulate an ArXiv-like intelligent assistant that helps users query complex research literature efficiently and reliably.
